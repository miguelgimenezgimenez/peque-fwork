# Common Express Framework

This framework is intended to provide a **standard** to help the **design**, **development**,
and **life-cycle management** of **scalable** and **efficient** server-side web application (with **Node.js**).
It can also be used to **invert the control** in a pre-existent Express application.

It is built on-top of **Express** and intended to be used with TypeScript even if JavaScript can still be used.
It delivers paradigms such as Object Oriented Programming (**OOP**), Aspect Oriented Programming (**AOP**),
Functional Programming (**FP**), and Dependency Injection (**DI**).

Built in house, it provides full control over knowledge, evolution, life-cycle, and dependency management.
